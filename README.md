# lennardtimm.de

This is the source code of my freelancing website at [lennardtimm.de](https://lennardtimm.de). I build it with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), a static site generator written in Ruby.

### Getting started

Within this directory, run `bundle` to install Middleman and its dependencies.

To start a web server, run `bin/middleman server`.

If you have Foreman or any other process runner capable of handling a `Procfile` installed, run `foreman start`.
