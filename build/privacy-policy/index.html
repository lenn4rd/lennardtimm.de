        <h2>1. An overview of data protection</h2>
    
        <h3>General information</h3>
    
        <p>The following information will provide you with an easy to navigate overview of what will happen with your personal data when you visit this website. The term “personal data” comprises all data that can be used to personally identify you. For detailed information about the subject matter of data protection, please consult our Data Protection Declaration, which we have included beneath this copy.</p>
    
        <h3>Data recording on this website</h3>
    
        <h4>Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e., the “controller”)?</h4>
    
        <p>The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website, whose contact information is available under section “Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)” in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with us. This may, for instance be information you enter into our contact form.</p>
    
        <p>Other data shall be recorded by our IT systems automatically or after you consent to its recording during your website visit. This data comprises primarily technical information (e.g., web browser, operating system, or time the site was accessed). This information is recorded automatically when you access this website.</p>
    
        <h4>What are the purposes we use your data for?</h4>

        <p>You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients, and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that your data are rectified or eradicated. If you have consented to data processing, you have the option to revoke this consent at any time, which shall affect all future data processing. Moreover, you have the right to demand that the processing of your data be restricted under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising agency.</p>
    
        <p>Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time if you have questions about this or any other data protection related issues.</p>
    
        <h3>Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties</h3>
    
        <p>There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be statistically analyzed when your visit this website. Such analyses are performed primarily with what we refer to as analysis programs.</p>
    
        <p>For detailed information about these analysis programs please consult our Data Protection Declaration below.</p>
    
        <h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
    
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
    
        <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
    
        <p>Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
    
        <p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.</p>
        <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)</h3> <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
    
        <p>Lennard Timm<br />
        Stubbenkammerstr. 5<br />
        10437 Berlin</p>
    
        <p class="f5">Phone: +49 (0)176 820 41 801<br />
        E-mail: <a href="mailto:hello@lennardtimm.de">hello@lennardtimm.de</a></p>
    
        <p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
    
        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
    
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
    
        <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA</h3>
    
        <p>Our website uses, in particular, tools from companies based in the USA. When these tools are active, your personal information may be transferred to the US servers of these companies. We must point out that the USA is not a safe third country within the meaning of EU data protection law. US companies are required to release personal data to security authorities without you as the data subject being able to take legal action against this. The possibility cannot therefore be excluded that US authorities (e.g. secret services) may process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes.  We have no influence over these processing activities.</p>
    
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
    
        <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
    
        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    
        <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).</p>
    
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2 GDPR).</p>
    
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
    
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
    
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    
        <p>You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p>
    
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
    
        <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    
        <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.</p>
    
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
    
        <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:</p>
    
        <ul> <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li> <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.</li> <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.</li> <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> </ul> <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
    
        <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
    
        <p>We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.</p>
    
        <h2>3. Recording of data on this website</h2>
    
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
    
        <p>Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.</p>
    
        <p>In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored on your device once you enter our site (third-party cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered by the third party (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment services).</p>
    
        <p>Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence of the cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.</p>
    
        <p>Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions (required cookies) or for the provision of certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure the technically error free and optimized provision of the operator’s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies has been requested, the respective cookies are stored exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR); this consent may be revoked at any time.</p>
    
        <p>You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.</p>
    
        <p>In the event that third-party cookies are used or if cookies are used for analytical purposes, we will separately notify you in conjunction with this Data Protection Policy and, if applicable, ask for your consent.</p>
    
        <h3>Server log files</h3>
    
        <p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:</p>
    
        <ul> <li>The type and version of browser used</li> <li>The used operating system</li> <li>Referrer URL</li> <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li> <li>The time of the server inquiry</li> <li>The IP address</li> </ul> <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
    
        <p>This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.</p>
    
        <h3>Contact form</h3>
    
        <p>If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this information without your consent.</p>
    
        <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your agreement (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested.</p>
    
        <p>The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.</p>
    
        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3> <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.</p>
    
        <p>These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR) if it has been obtained.</p>
    
        <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
    
        <h3>Calendly</h3>
    
        <p>You can make appointments with us on our website. We use the “Calendly” tool for booking appointments. The provider is Calendly LLC, 271 17th St NW, 10th Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30363, USA (hereinafter “Calendly”).</p>
    
        <p>To book an appointment, enter the requested data and the desired date in the screen provided. The data entered will be used for planning, executing and, if necessary, for the follow-up of the appointment.</p>
    
        <p>The data you have entered will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent for storage or the purpose for which the data was stored ceases to apply. Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
    
        <p>The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). The website operator has a justified interest in making appointments with interested parties and customers in as uncomplicated a manner as possible.</p>
    
        <p class="f5">The data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission. Details can be found here: <a href="https://calendly.com/pages/dpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://calendly.com/pages/dpa</a>.</p>
    
        <h4>Contract data processing agreement</h4>
    
        <p>We have concluded a contract for order processing with Calendly. This is a data protection contract that guarantees that Calendly only processes the personal data of our visitors to the website according to our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Analysis tools and advertising</h2>
    
        <h3>LinkedIn Insight Tag</h3>
    
        <p>This website uses the Insight tag from LinkedIn. This service is provided by LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
    
        <h4>Data processing by LinkedIn Insight tag</h4>
    
        <p>We use the LinkedIn Insight tag to obtain information about visitors to our website. Once a website visitor is registered with LinkedIn, we can analyze the key occupational data (e.g., career level, company size, country, location, industry, job title) of our website visitors to help us better target our site to the relevant audience. We can also use LinkedIn Insight tags to measure whether visitors to our websites make a purchase or perform other actions (conversion measurement). Conversion measurement can also be carried out across devices (e.g. from PC to tablet). LinkedIn Insight Tag also features a retargeting function that allows us to display targeted advertising to visitors to our website outside of the website. According to LinkedIn, no identification of the advertising addressee takes place.</p>
    
        <p>LinkedIn itself also collects log files (URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser characteristics and time of access). The IP addresses are shortened or (if they are used to reach LinkedIn members across devices) hashed (pseudonymized). The direct identifiers of LinkedIn members are deleted by LinkedIn after seven days. The remaining pseudonymized data will then be deleted within 180 days.</p>
    
        <p class="f5">The data collected by LinkedIn cannot be assigned by us as a website operator to specific individuals. LinkedIn will store the personal data collected from website visitors on its servers in the USA and use it for its own promotional activities. For details, please see LinkedIn’s privacy policy at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#choices-oblig</a>.</p>
    
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
    
        <p>The use of LinkedIn Insight is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in effective advertising measures, including social media. If a corresponding consent has been requested (e.g. consent to the storage of cookies), the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
    
        <p class="f5">Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/dpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/dpa</a> und <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/eu-sccs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/eu-sccs</a>.</p>
    
        <h4>Objection to the use of LinkedIn Insight Tag</h4>
    
        <p class="f5">You can object to LinkedIn’s analysis of user behavior and targeted advertising at the following link: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out</a>.</p>
    
        <p>In addition, LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal information for promotional purposes in the account settings. To prevent LinkedIn from linking information collected on our site to your LinkedIn account, you must log out of your LinkedIn account before you visit our site.</p>
    
        <h4>Execution of a contract data processing agreement</h4>
    
        <p>We have entered into a contract data processing agreement with LinkedIn.</p>
    
        <h3>Snowplow</h3>
    
        <p>This website uses a web-tracking solution based on the Snowplow Analytics technology. In conjunction with the performance of analyses using Snowplow, it is possible to e.g. analyze the number of visitors and their behavior patterns during visits (e.g. number of pages accessed, duration of their visits to the website, percentage of aborted visits), visitor origins (i.e. from which site does the visitor arrive at our site), visitor locations as well as technical data (browser and session of operating system used). For these purposes, we archive in particular the following data:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Referrer (previously visited website)</li>
          <li>Accessed page on the website or file</li>
          <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
          <li>Used operating system</li>
          <li>Type of device used</li>
          <li>Website access time</li>
          <li>Anonymized IP address (used only to determine the access location)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>The data recorded are completely anonymized so they cannot be tracked back to individuals. We store these data on the servers we administer. We do not archive cookies.</p>
    
        <p>The data are stored and analyzed pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the statistical analysis of user patterns to optimize both, the operator’s web presentation as well as the operator’s promotional activities.

        <h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
    
        <h3>Newsletter data</h3>
    
        <p>If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this website, we will need from you an e-mail address as well as information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and consent to the receipt of the newsletter. No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on a voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the requested information and shall not share such data with any third parties.</p>
    
        <p>The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.</p>
    
        <p>The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to apply. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
    
        <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>
    
        <h3>MailChimp</h3>
    
        <p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
    
        <p>Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organize and analyze the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.</p>
    
        <p>With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyze the performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.</p>
    
        <p>If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this in every newsletter message.</p>
    
        <p>The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR).  You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.</p>
    
        <p>The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.</p>
    
        <p class="f5">Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission. Details can be found here: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/eu-us-data-transfer-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mailchimp.com/eu-us-data-transfer-statement/</a> and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/#Annex_C_-_Standard_Contractual_Clauses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/#Annex_C_-_Standard_Contractual_Clauses</a>.</p>
    
        <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>

    <h4>Execution of a contract data processing agreement</h4>
    
    <p>We have executed a so-called “Data Processing Agreement” with MailChimp, in which we mandate that MailChimp undertakes to protect the data of our customers and to refrain from sharing it with third parties.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Online-based Audio and Video Conferences (Conference tools)</h2>
    
        <h4>Data processing</h4>
    
        <p>We use online conference tools, among other things, for communication with our customers. The tools we use are listed in detail below. If you communicate with us by video or audio conference using the Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by the provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The conferencing tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools (email address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of participation in the conference, number of participants and other “context information” related to the communication process (metadata).</p>
    
        <p>Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data required for the processing of the online communication. This includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.</p>
    
        <p>Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while using the service.</p>
    
        <p>Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in the data protection declarations of the tools used, and which we have listed below this text.</p>
    
        <h4>Purpose and legal bases</h4>
    
        <p>The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our customers (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us or our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question will be used on the basis of this consent; the consent may be revoked at any time with effect from that date.</p>
    
        <h4>Duration of storage</h4>
    
        <p>Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
    
        <p>We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that is stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own purposes. For details, please directly contact the operators of the conference tools.</p>
    
        <h4>Conference tools used</h4>
    
        <p>We employ the following conference tools:</p>
